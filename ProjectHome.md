# OpenCapture #

OpenCapture is a java open-source document capture system.  Our goal is to provide a capture system that can cross platforms.  In the current market all major document capture systems are designed to run on the windows platform.  We hope to provide a good alternative.

## Update 10/14/2008 ##

All, we apologize for not getting this information to you sooner.  We've decided to not release 0.0.2 as planned.  The reason being we don't have any major updates to the code other than small bug fixes.  Also, as we've not seen any comments or questions we believe those of you using OC are not running into any serious issues.  Release 0.0.2 will be released later this month once we've completed buidling/testing the administration module.  If you are interested in seeing what's currently available in 0.0.2, please check CVS or drop an email and we'd be happy to provide a build.  Thanks for your support and please continue to check back.

## Update 9/25/2008 ##

OpenCapture 0.0.2 is planned for release on October 13, 2008.  This next release will contain fixes for a few bugs found as well as a new delivery plugin for Alfresco.  Please continue to check back for updated documentation and releases.

## OpenCapture 0.0.1 Released 9/1/2008 ##

Finally, the initial release of OC is available.  There's a long road ahead of us filled with updates and fixes so please let us know what you think.  I'd also like to send out a special thanks to the folks working on the ZXing project.  Without their efforts, OC would not be possible.

### Update 08/17/2008 ###

Beta 0.0.1 is planned for release on September 1, 2008.  The wiki is updated almost daily with new or updated information.  If you'd like to get a head start, checkout the GettingStarted document along with the other configuration documentation.

## OpenCapture 0.0.1 Beta ##

Our first beta is just about ready.  There's a lot of configuration that has to be done in order to use the system.  We hope that this will not deter anyone from attempting to use OpenCapture.  Please continue to check back for updated information.  Also regularly check the wiki as we'll be documenting on a more frequent basis from this point forward.
