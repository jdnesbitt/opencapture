#summary BatchClass tag in the BatchClass and Batch definition files.

= Introduction =

A batch class represents a batch or set of documents that are similar in type and should be grouped together when scanning or importing.


= Details =

As an example take the following mortgage documents.
  * Appraisal
  * Note
  * W9

The above documents all fit into the same category of documents.  When using OpenCapture these documents would be scanned into the same batch class as they are all mortgage documents.

Consider the following document types:

  * Invoice
  * Phone Bill
  * Electric Bill

These are not types of mortgage documents and therefore should not be scanned into a mortgage batch class.  Instead, another batch class should be created for these documents.
