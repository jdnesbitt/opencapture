#summary Imports documents into OpenCapture.

= Introduction =

The Import module is used to perform file system imports.  A configuration file is used to identify the directories the import module should poll for new documents.


= Details =

OCImport currently supports TIFF files only.  Future releases will support other formats such as PDF.  Trigger files are used only as a triggering mechanism to identify files ready for import.  The Import module uses a configuration file.  The startup script points to a configuration file named ocimport.properties.  The ocimport.properties file should contain the following properties:

|| oc_home || OC Home property should point to the root OpenCapture directory. ||
|| log4j || Path to the log4j property file. ||
|| polldircount || Number of directories to poll.  Each direcotry will have an associated number. ||
|| polldir.n || Directory to poll. N represent the directory number to poll. ||
|| archivepath.n || Path to the directory where imported files should be stored once imported. ||
|| batchclass.n || Batch Class the documents should be assigned to. ||
|| importfilesonly.n || If importing files only meaning there are no trigger files to signify a file can be imported. ||
|| importtrigger.n || Use this if importfilesonly=no.  This will be the extension of the trigger file( ex: xml) ||


=== Example Configuration File ===

{{{
# OpenCapture home
oc_home=/home/dnesbitt/NetBeansProjects/OCModules

# Log 4 j config file
log4j=/home/dnesbitt/NetBeansProjects/OCModules/config/log4j-ocimport.properties

# Number of poll directories configured.
polldircount=1

# Images to import into OpenCapture are here
polldir.1=/home/dnesbitt/Test/OpenCapture/TEST_IMAGES

# Path where imported images will be archived.
archivepath.1=/home/dnesbitt/Test/OpenCapture/TEST_IMAGES/Archive

# Batch Class the images should be assigned to
batchclass.1=Carrier Files

# If importing files only meaning there are no trigger files to
# signify a file can be imported.
importfilesonly.1=yes

# Use this if importfilesonly=no.  This will be the extension
# of the trigger file( ex: xml)
importtrigger.1=
