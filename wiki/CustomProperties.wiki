#summary CustomProperties are used to define name value pairs.

= Introduction =

CustomProperties are used at both the BatchClass and Batch levels.  A custom property might be used to define a name value pair used by a custom plugin.


= Details =

CustomProperties at the BatchClass level are used to define values for custom plugins.  If a delivery plugin was developed to deliver documents to Alfresco, the CustomProperties secion in the BatchClass might contain a property for hostname, userid, password, etc.  These values could be retrieved from the CustomProperties section of the BatchClass Configuration and used for delivery.

CustomProperties at the Batch level are used in the Document section.  They define information about a specific document.  These name value pairs can also be created and/or used by custom plugins.
